##### Lecture Series

* I have given a lecture series introducing neural networks and their applications to researchers in string theory at Uppsala University HT 2020. The material can be found [here](https://github.com/robin-schneider/STmML) it includes several notebooks reproducing results from recent papers. The topics covered are: (convolutional) neural networks, bias-variance tradeoff, (variational-) autoencoder and a brief introduction to reinforcement learning.

##### Teaching

* During the terms [VT2018](https://studentportalen.uu.se/portal/portal/uusp/student/staff-list?uusp.portalpage=true&toolMode=studentUse&entityId=146928&toolAttachmentId=511402) and [VT2019](https://studentportalen.uu.se/portal/portal/uusp/student/staff-list?uusp.portalpage=true&toolMode=studentUse&entityId=157973&toolAttachmentId=567581) I taught the quantum physics course for second year undergraduates at Uppsala University. 

##### Master Students

I have (co-)supervised master student projects.

* With [Davide Passaro](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/p/a/d.passaro/d.passaro.html?cb) we were building heterotic line bundle models on generalized Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds. This lead to the following [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09763). His thesis can be found [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1435146&dswid=-8556).
* With Àlvaro Fernàndez we were constructing numerical approximations of Calabi-Yau metrics. His thesis can be found [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1573373&dswid=5333).
