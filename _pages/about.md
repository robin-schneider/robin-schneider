I am a PhD student at Uppsala University investigating heterotic compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds in [Magdalena Larfors](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1034652?ui-citation-summary=true) group. I am particularly interested in applying tools from machine learning to problems in string theory. Such applications include, on the one hand, finding realistic string compactifications with [Actor-Critic agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04817) from reinforcement learning. On the other hand, I employ [deep convolutional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02221) state-of-the-art image recognition architecture to learn the cohomologies of Calabi-Yau manifolds. 

Before coming to Uppsala, I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), with an Erasmus year at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/). During my Master's studies, I also participated in a one year research exchange with [IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), where I worked with [Yuji Tachikawa](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/).
