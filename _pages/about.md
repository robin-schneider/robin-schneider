I am currently working at ASML as a machine learning engineer. I'm part of modeling and inference group lead by Henk-Jan Smilde. As part of my work I leverage deep learning and techniques from computer vision to analyze images from the YieldStar. In addition I'm improving the whole MLops and data orchestration pipeline from acquiring and processing data to training and selecting the best ML models to finally deploying them.

Before that I was a PhD student at Uppsala University investigating heterotic compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds in [Magdalena Larfors](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1034652?ui-citation-summary=true) group. In my thesis I used techniques from machine learning to solve problems in string theory. For example, I found semi-realistic string compactifications with [Actor-Critic agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04817) from reinforcement learning. On the other hand, I employed [deep convolutional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02221) neural nets to learn the cohomologies of Calabi-Yau manifolds and developed a [tensorflow package](https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric) to find solutions to the multi-objective optimisation problem of finding [Ricci-flat metrics](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2021/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2021_37.pdf).

Before my time in Uppsala I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), with an Erasmus year at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/). During my Master's studies, I also participated in a one year research exchange with [IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), where I worked with [Yuji Tachikawa](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/).
