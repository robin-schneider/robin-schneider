I am currently working at ASML as a Product Performance Engineeer. In this role I leverage machine learning to find novel ways of inferring physical quantities from optical metrology data.

Before that I was a PhD student at Uppsala University investigating heterotic compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds in [Magdalena Larfors](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1034652?ui-citation-summary=true) group. In my thesis I used techniques from machine learning to solve problems in string theory. For example, I found semi-realistic string compactifications with [Actor-Critic agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04817) from reinforcement learning. On the other hand, I employed [deep convolutional](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02221) neural nets to learn the cohomologies of Calabi-Yau manifolds and developed a [tensorflow package](https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric) to find solutions to the multi-objective optimisation problem of finding [Ricci-flat metrics](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2021/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2021_37.pdf).

Before my time in Uppsala I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), with an Erasmus year at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/). During my Master's studies, I also participated in a one year research exchange with [IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), where I worked with [Yuji Tachikawa](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/).
