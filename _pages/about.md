I am a PhD student at Uppsala University investigating heterotic compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds in Magdalena Larfors group. I am particularly interested in applying tools from machine learning to problems in string theory. Such applications include on the one [hand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04817) the finding of realistic string compactifications with Actor-Critic agents from reinforcement learning. On the other [hand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02221) I employ deep convolutional state-of-the-art image recognition architecture to learn the cohomologies of Calabi-Yau manifolds. 

Before coming to Uppsala I did my undergraduates in physics at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) with an Erasmus year at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/). During my master studies I also participated in a one year research exchange with [IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).
